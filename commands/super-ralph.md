# /super-ralph

The user wants to run the Super Ralph autonomous agentic loop.

**Invoke the `super-ralph` skill immediately** with the user's query. The skill handles everything:

1. Brainstorm (interactive Q&A to explore intent, scope, and edge cases with the user)
2. Pre-flight scoping (ask user about workspace boundaries)
3. Once user says "go ahead" → **fully autonomous from here, zero questions**
4. Decompose the query into tasks with high quality standards
4. For each task: write tests first, then implement until tests pass
5. Self-debug on failure (debug.md → cold analysis → retry)
6. Auto-skip tasks that fail after 6 attempts (log to learnings)
7. Capture learnings to learnings.md
8. Merge all outputs into a cohesive deliverable

The user's query is: ${ARGUMENTS}

**Start by invoking the super-ralph skill now.**
