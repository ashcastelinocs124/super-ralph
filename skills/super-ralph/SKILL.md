name: super-ralph
description: Autonomous agentic loop that decomposes any user query into tasks, writes tests first, implements with fresh sub-agents, self-debugs on failure, and learns over time. Use when the user says "super ralph", "ralph this", "break this down and build it", or wants autonomous multi-task execution with quality enforcement.

# Super Ralph

Autonomous agentic loop: decompose → test → build → debug → learn → merge.

## Quick Reference

```
User Query
  → Brainstorm: interactive Q&A to explore intent, scope, edge cases (AskUserQuestion loop)
  → Tooling: scan available skills/agents, ask user about goals, assemble custom toolset
  → Pre-Flight: scope workspace + set MAX_RETRIES (AskUserQuestion)
  → Decompose: orchestrator breaks query into tasks directly (no separate planner agent)
  → Per Task (sequential, foreground — never run agents in background):
      → ralph-tester: write strict tests
      → ralph-worker: implement until tests pass (with selected skills/agents available)
      → Fail MAX_RETRIES/2? → debug.md → ralph-debugger → fresh ralph-worker
      → Fail MAX_RETRIES? → auto-skip + log to learnings
      → Pass → clear debug.md
  → ralph-merger: combine outputs + write consolidated learnings entry + summary report
```

## Agents

| Agent | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| ralph-tester | `agents/ralph-tester.md` | Writes strict tests before implementation |
| ralph-worker | `agents/ralph-worker.md` | Implements until tests pass, writes debug.md on attempt 3 |
| ralph-debugger | `agents/ralph-debugger.md` | Cold analysis of failures, writes fix plan |
| ralph-merger | `agents/ralph-merger.md` | Combines outputs into cohesive deliverable |

**Note:** Planning/decomposition is handled directly by the orchestrator (this skill), not a separate agent. The orchestrator already has the brainstorm summary, tooling config, learnings, and codebase context — no need to dispatch a separate planner.

---

## IMPORTANT: Fully Autonomous After Pre-Flight

After Phase 0, the entire loop runs **without any user interaction**. No `AskUserQuestion` calls, no confirmations, no escalations. If something fails after max retries, auto-skip it and log to learnings. The user said "go ahead" — respect that.

---

## Phase -1: Brainstorm (BLOCKING — interactive Q&A before anything else)

Before scoping the workspace or planning tasks, **explore the user's idea through conversation**. The goal is to deeply understand what the user actually wants — not just what they typed.

**This phase is interactive.** Use `AskUserQuestion` in a loop until both sides are aligned.

### How it works

1. **Restate the query** — show the user your understanding of what they're asking for in 2-3 sentences. This surfaces misunderstandings early.

2. **Ask clarifying questions** — use `AskUserQuestion` to explore:

```
question: "[Specific question about the user's intent, scope, or approach]"
header: "Clarify"
options:
  - label: "[Most likely answer]"
    description: "[What this means for the build]"
  - label: "[Alternative interpretation]"
    description: "[What this means for the build]"
  - label: "[Simpler/narrower version]"
    description: "[What this means for the build]"
multiSelect: false
```

3. **Explore iteratively** — after each answer, ask follow-up questions if new ambiguities surface. Cover these areas:

| Area | Example Questions |
|------|-------------------|
| **Intent** | "Is this a prototype or production-grade?" |
| **Scope** | "Should this include X, or is that out of scope?" |
| **Edge cases** | "What should happen when Y occurs?" |
| **Users** | "Who will use this — just you, your team, or end users?" |
| **Constraints** | "Any specific tech stack, libraries, or patterns to use/avoid?" |
| **Existing work** | "Is this building on something that already exists, or greenfield?" |

4. **Produce a brainstorm summary** — when you have enough clarity, write a summary:

```markdown
## Brainstorm Summary

**Query:** {original user query}
**Intent:** {what the user actually wants, in your words}

### Scope
- {what's in scope}
- {what's explicitly out of scope}

### Key Decisions
- {decision 1 from the Q&A}
- {decision 2 from the Q&A}

### Edge Cases Discussed
- {edge case and agreed handling}

### Constraints
- {any tech/approach constraints from the user}
```

5. **Confirm the summary** — show the summary to the user with one final `AskUserQuestion`:

```
question: "Here's what I'll build. Does this capture it?"
header: "Confirm"
options:
  - label: "Yes, go ahead"
    description: "This is right — proceed to workspace setup and autonomous execution"
  - label: "Almost — let me adjust"
    description: "I'll clarify what needs changing"
multiSelect: false
```

If "Almost" → incorporate feedback, update summary, re-confirm. If "Yes" → store the summary as `BRAINSTORM_SUMMARY` and proceed to Phase 0.

### Rules

- Ask **2-5 questions total** — enough to remove ambiguity, not so many it feels like an interrogation
- Batch related questions into a single `AskUserQuestion` when possible (up to 4 per call)
- Don't ask questions the user already answered in their original query
- Don't ask about workspace scope here — that's Phase 0's job
- If the query is dead simple and unambiguous (e.g., "add a .gitignore"), skip brainstorming entirely

### Passing the summary forward

The `BRAINSTORM_SUMMARY` is used by the orchestrator during task decomposition (Phase 1) alongside learnings, tooling config, and workspace rules. This ensures tasks are decomposed based on the *explored, confirmed intent* — not just the raw query.

---

## Phase -0.5: Tooling Discovery (BLOCKING — after brainstorm, before pre-flight)

After understanding *what* the user wants to build, figure out *what tools will help build it*. Scan available skills and agents, match them to the user's goals, and let the user confirm or adjust the toolset.

### How it works

#### Step 1: Scan available skills and agents

Search for all available skills and agents in the environment:

```bash
# Scan for skills
find ~/.claude/skills/ -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null
find .claude/skills/ -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null

# Scan for agents
find ~/.claude/agents/ -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null
find .claude/agents/ -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null

# Also check for project-local skills
find . -path "*/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null
```

Read the `name` and `description` fields from each discovered skill/agent file. Build an inventory:

```
AVAILABLE_SKILLS:
- frontend-design: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces
- system-arch: Plan major architecture changes and evaluate patterns
- claude-api: Build apps with the Claude API or Anthropic SDK
- doc-search: Search third-party API documentation before writing code
- ...

AVAILABLE_AGENTS:
- code-reviewer: Validate work against plan and coding standards
- root-cause-hunter: Drive root-cause analysis for failures
- integration-test-validator: Comprehensive testing validation
- ...
```

#### Step 2: Match tools to the user's goals

Based on the `BRAINSTORM_SUMMARY`, identify which skills and agents would be useful. Consider:

| User's Goal | Relevant Tools |
|------------|----------------|
| Building a frontend/UI | `frontend-design`, `landing-page` |
| API development | `doc-search`, `claude-api`, `system-arch` |
| Complex architecture | `system-arch`, `validation`, `debate` |
| Refactoring | `code-reviewer`, `integration-test-validator` |
| Using third-party APIs | `doc-search` (auto-fetch docs before coding) |
| Full-stack app | `frontend-design`, `system-arch`, `doc-search` |

#### Step 3: Present recommendations to user

Show the matched tools and let the user select which to activate for this run:

```
question: "Based on what you're building, these skills/agents could help. Which should I use during this run?"
header: "Tooling"
options:
  - label: "[Recommended set]"
    description: "Use {skill-1}, {skill-2}, {agent-1} — covers {reason}"
  - label: "All available"
    description: "Activate everything — I'll use whatever helps"
  - label: "Just the defaults"
    description: "Only use Ralph's 5 built-in agents, no extra skills"
multiSelect: false
```

If the user picks "Recommended set" or "All available", also ask if there are specific tools they want to add or exclude:

```
question: "Anything to add or exclude from the toolset?"
header: "Adjust"
options:
  - label: "Looks good — proceed"
    description: "Use the selected toolset as-is"
  - label: "Add a skill"
    description: "I'll name a specific skill or capability to include"
  - label: "Remove something"
    description: "I'll say what to exclude"
multiSelect: false
```

#### Step 4: Build TOOLING_CONFIG

Store the selected toolset as `TOOLING_CONFIG`:

```markdown
## Tooling Config

### Active Skills
- {skill-name}: {how it will be used in this run}
- {skill-name}: {how it will be used in this run}

### Active Agents (beyond Ralph defaults)
- {agent-name}: {when to invoke during the run}

### Skill Integration Rules
- {skill-name} → invoke before {phase/step} (e.g., "doc-search → invoke before ralph-worker writes API calls")
- {skill-name} → invoke during {phase/step} (e.g., "frontend-design → invoke when ralph-worker builds UI components")
```

### How TOOLING_CONFIG is used

The config is used by the orchestrator and injected into sub-agent prompts:

- **Orchestrator** uses `TOOLING_CONFIG` during task decomposition to tag tasks with `skills_to_use` (e.g., "Use `doc-search` to check the Stripe API before implementing payment logic")
- **ralph-worker** gets the skill integration rules so it knows when to invoke skills during implementation (e.g., invoke `frontend-design` before building a component, invoke `doc-search` before calling a third-party API)
- **ralph-merger** gets the list so it can note which tools were used in the summary report

### Rules

- Don't overwhelm the user — recommend 2-4 tools max, not every skill in the system
- If no extra skills are relevant (e.g., the task is pure backend with standard libraries), say so and suggest "Just the defaults"
- Skills that the user's project already has in its local `.claude/skills/` take priority over global ones
- If a skill would clearly help but isn't installed, mention it: "You don't have a {X} skill, but it might help here. Want to skip it or create one?"
- If the brainstorm summary makes the tooling obvious (e.g., "build a landing page" → `landing-page` skill), pre-select it as the recommended option

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Flight Scoping (BLOCKING — workspace setup)

Before any agent runs, scope the workspace using `AskUserQuestion`. **This is the ONLY phase that asks the user anything.**

**Question 1 — Writable directories:**
```
question: "Which files/folders should I work in? (I'll create and modify files here)"
header: "Work in"
options:
  - label: "Current directory"
    description: "Work in the current project root and subdirectories"
  - label: "Specific paths"
    description: "I'll list the exact directories/files"
multiSelect: false
```

**Question 2 — Read-only context:**
```
question: "Any files I should read for context but NOT modify?"
header: "Read-only"
options:
  - label: "None — figure it out"
    description: "Explore the codebase yourself"
  - label: "I'll list them"
    description: "Specific files/dirs to read but not touch"
multiSelect: false
```

**Question 3 — Off-limits:**
```
question: "Anything off-limits? (files/folders I must never touch)"
header: "Off-limits"
options:
  - label: "Nothing off-limits"
    description: "You can work anywhere within the writable scope"
  - label: "I'll list exclusions"
    description: "Specific paths to avoid"
multiSelect: false
```

**Question 4 — Retry limit per task:**
```
question: "How many retries per task before giving up?"
header: "Max retries"
options:
  - label: "6 (default)"
    description: "3 normal attempts + debug analysis + 3 more attempts"
  - label: "4"
    description: "2 normal attempts + debug analysis + 2 more attempts"
  - label: "10"
    description: "5 normal attempts + debug analysis + 5 more attempts"
multiSelect: false
```

Store the retry limit as `MAX_RETRIES`. The debug trigger fires at `MAX_RETRIES / 2` (halfway). After `MAX_RETRIES` total attempts, auto-skip.

Store the answers as `WORKSPACE_RULES` — inject into every sub-agent prompt:

```
WORKSPACE RULES:
- You may READ and WRITE files in: [writable paths]
- You may READ (not modify): [read-only paths]
- Do NOT touch: [off-limits paths]
- All permissions granted — do not ask for confirmation on any action.
```

---

## Phase 1: Plan & Decompose (orchestrator does this directly)

The orchestrator decomposes the query itself — no separate planner agent needed. It already has everything: BRAINSTORM_SUMMARY, TOOLING_CONFIG, learnings, codebase context, and WORKSPACE_RULES.

### Step 1: Gather context

1. Read `learnings.md` — extract relevant past insights. If a pattern failed before, don't repeat it.
2. Read the scoped codebase files to understand existing patterns and conventions.

### Step 2: Decompose into tasks

Break the query into the smallest independent tasks possible. Apply these principles:

- **Set the bar HIGH** — every task must produce work worth shipping
- **Be specific, not vague** — "handles edge cases" is useless. "Returns 404 with JSON error body when resource not found" is testable.
- **Prevent laziness upfront** — anti-patterns tell the worker what NOT to do before they start cutting corners
- **Smallest independent units** — if a task can be split further without creating artificial dependencies, split it
- **Reference available skills** — use TOOLING_CONFIG to tag tasks with `skills_to_use` where relevant

Output a JSON task array:

```json
[
  {
    "task_id": 1,
    "title": "Short descriptive title",
    "description": "Detailed description of what to build. Be explicit about behavior, inputs, outputs, and constraints.",
    "quality_standard": "What 'excellent' looks like. Be specific. No shortcuts, no TODOs, no stubs. Production-grade or it doesn't count.",
    "success_criteria": [
      "Specific testable outcome — an assertion, not a wish",
      "Another specific testable outcome"
    ],
    "anti_patterns": [
      "Don't stub or mock the hard parts",
      "Don't skip error handling",
      "Don't leave TODOs or placeholder logic"
    ],
    "dependencies": [],
    "test_strategy": "What tests to write, what to assert, what framework to use",
    "skills_to_use": ["skill-name — when and why to invoke it during this task"]
  }
]
```

### Quality rules for decomposition

- Success criteria must be **assertions** — things a test can verify, not feelings
- Anti-patterns should target the **most common lazy shortcuts** for this specific task
- If a task touches existing code, specify which files and what the expected behavior change is
- If a task has no dependencies, say `"dependencies": []` — don't invent false dependencies
- Each task should be completable by a single agent in one session
- If you're unsure whether something should be one task or two, make it two

### Step 3: Set up workspace

```bash
mkdir -p workspace/task-{id}/tests workspace/task-{id}/output
```

### Step 4: Dispatch tasks

Dispatch tasks **sequentially in the foreground** (never use `run_in_background`). Tasks with dependencies wait for their dependencies to complete first. Independent tasks are dispatched one at a time.

---

## CRITICAL: Agent Dispatch Rule

**All sub-agents MUST run in the foreground.** Never set `run_in_background: true` when dispatching agents via the Agent tool. Background agents cannot prompt the user for tool permission approvals (WebSearch, WebFetch, Bash, etc.), causing tools to be auto-denied and agents to fail silently. Accept sequential execution over losing tool access.

---

## Phase 2: Per-Task Execution Loop

For each task from the planner. Run tasks **sequentially** (foreground agents cannot run in parallel).

### Step 2a: Test Agent

Dispatch **ralph-tester** with: task definition + WORKSPACE_RULES

Tester writes tests to `workspace/task-{id}/tests/` and reports the test command.

### Step 2b: Worker Agent (with retry loop)

```
attempt = 0
debug_trigger = MAX_RETRIES / 2   # e.g. 3 if MAX_RETRIES=6

while true:
    attempt += 1

    if attempt == 1:
        failure_context = ""
    else:
        failure_context = "PREVIOUS ATTEMPT FAILED:\n{last_test_output}\n\nFix the root cause."

    if attempt == debug_trigger:
        Add to prompt: "This is attempt {debug_trigger}. You MUST write debug.md before exiting."

    Dispatch fresh ralph-worker with:
      task definition + test locations + failure_context + TOOLING_CONFIG + WORKSPACE_RULES

    Run tests via Bash: {test_command}

    if tests pass:
        break → clear debug.md if it exists

    if attempt == debug_trigger and tests still fail:
        enter Phase 2c (self-debugging)

    if attempt >= MAX_RETRIES:
        enter Phase 2c Step 4 (auto-skip)
```

### Step 2c: Validator

Run tests via Bash after each worker attempt:
- **Pass** → clear debug.md, continue to next task
- **Fail** → retry worker with failure output

---

## Phase 2c: Self-Debugging (after MAX_RETRIES/2 failed attempts)

### Step 1: debug.md already written
The worker at attempt `MAX_RETRIES/2` writes `debug.md` with all attempts so far, reasoning, and pattern analysis.

### Step 2: Fresh Debug Agent
Dispatch **ralph-debugger** — reads debug.md cold, identifies root cause, appends fix plan.

### Step 3: Fresh Worker follows fix plan
Dispatch fresh **ralph-worker** (attempts `MAX_RETRIES/2 + 1` through `MAX_RETRIES`) with debug.md. Worker follows the fix plan exactly.

Run tests again:
- **Pass** → clear debug.md, continue to next task
- **Fail after attempt MAX_RETRIES** → auto-skip (Step 4)

### Step 4: Auto-Skip (MAX_RETRIES reached, still failing)

**Do NOT ask the user.** The loop is fully autonomous after pre-flight.

1. Mark the task as **FAILED**
2. Keep the task's failure trail (attempts, debug analysis) in memory for the merger
3. Continue with remaining tasks — do not stop the loop

---

## Phase 3: Merge, Learn & Deliver

After ALL tasks complete, dispatch **ralph-merger** in the **foreground** (never background) with:
- All task titles, statuses, attempt counts, and output directories
- Per-task notes: what worked, what failed, debug insights (passed in prompt, not in learnings.md)
- WORKSPACE_RULES

### Step 3a: Merge outputs

Merger combines outputs into `workspace/final/`, resolves integration issues.

### Step 3b: Write ONE consolidated learnings entry

The merger synthesizes all per-task insights into **a single entry** appended to `learnings.md`:

```markdown
## {date} — {original user query (shortened)}

**Result:** {passed}/{total} tasks passed ({total_attempts} total attempts)

### Key Learnings
- {insight that transfers to future runs — from any task}
- {another generalizable insight}
- {root cause from debug sessions, if any}

### Patterns to Reuse
- {architectural pattern that worked well}
- {library/tool choice that proved effective}

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- {approach that failed and why — only if it's a trap others would fall into}
```

**Rules for this entry:**
- Only include insights that would help a **different future query** — skip task-specific noise
- If debug mode was used, extract the root cause as a learning (the shared wrong assumption)
- Keep it concise — aim for 5-15 bullet points total, not a wall of text
- Task-specific details (individual attempt logs, test output) stay in the summary report only

### Step 3c: Clear debug.md

If debug.md was used during the run, clear it:
```
_Empty — ready for next debug session._
```

debug.md is a scratch pad. learnings.md is the permanent record.

### Step 3d: Summary report

Produce the summary report and present it to the user. The merged output in `workspace/final/` is the deliverable.
